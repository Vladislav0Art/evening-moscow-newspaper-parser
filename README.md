## Description

Parser allows to extract some data about the cinema schedule from the [electro.nekrasovka.ru](https://electro.nekrasovka.ru/editions/1/1953/9?page=1) website for the newspaper "Вечерняя Москва" (Evening Moscow).

An example of the page that can be parsed is [here](https://electro.nekrasovka.ru/books/6173751/pages/4). Notice, that it is a concrete newspaper release on its **4th page** where the daily cinema schedule usually resides.

The script extracts text of the page scan available under the "Как текст" button:

### Thread of validity

The page scans available on the website **may NOT** reflect the actual content of the image in full, due to likely being automatically parsed from the image. Artifacts, misspelled text, and missing text excerpts occasionally occur. Therefore, this script **should NOT** be treated as a full-fledged one-click parsing solution but rather as a helping facility; **manual afford and proof-reading encouraged**.
